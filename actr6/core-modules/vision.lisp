;;; Description : Source code for the ACT-R 6 Vision Module.  
;;;
;;; Bugs        : [X] Should object-present-p do a chunk match to determine if
;;;                   the object is still the "same"?  I'm doing that now, but
;;;                   may want to consider something else long term...
;;;                   UPDATE: not doing the chunk test now because it results 
;;;                   in differences where a change is not re-encoded that 
;;;                   which should be with update-attended-loc.  May still
;;;                   want to consider other options.
;;;             : [ ] Not so much a bug, but an inconsistency with the old
;;;                   version.  Find-best-feature doesn't "short circuit"
;;;                   as often with the legacy devices as the old system which
;;;                   means that it calls random-item at times where the same
;;;                   model under the old module didn't.  The behavior of this
;;;                   module is the same regardless, but the extra call to
;;;                   act-r-random will result in different "random" results
;;;                   downstream from the extra call in other modules or code.
;;;                   Only really matters if one has set the seed explicitly
;;;                   to produce a specific output (the testing traces).  Shouldn't
;;;                   cause problems otherwise.  
;;;             : [X] Current module doesn't work quite the same as the old version
;;;                   when items overlap in the display.  Particularly, a screen
;;;                   change during an attention shift for items at the same location
;;;                   in the old module you got the "old" attended item but in the
;;;                   current module you get the "new" item.  Not sure what is
;;;                   really right there.  Switched it so that now you get the
;;;                   old item as well.
;;;
;;; Todo        : [ ] Check the icon-entry code again now that the feats get
;;;                   mapped from old to new when there's no clear because it
;;;                   probably doesn't need to do the "feat match" check anymore...
;;;             : [X] Add in the support for other scales/synthesizing letters from
;;;                   primitives and re-enable the :optimize-visual parameter.
;;;             : [X] Add the tracking code in.
;;;             : [ ] Add hooks into proc-display and find-location to let users
;;;                   configure things and filter the matching (pre and post default)
;;;                   as needed.
;;;             : [ ] Consider generalizing the scale parameter so that the devices
;;;                   can take advantage of it for other uses.
;;;             : [ ] What's the right attended status for something that's no
;;;                   longer in the visicon or for overlapping new items?
;;;                   *Essentially added an "undefined" attended status for
;;;                   *items that are no longer in the visicon - it always
;;;                   *returns nil for the query regardless of the request
;;;                   *which varies from the old module because the old one would 
;;;                   *consider items no longer in the display as "attended nil".
;;;                   -- changed this because if it's a visual-location then it
;;;                   should return "attended nil" as t if it's truely not attended.
;;;                   However, this and the old module now differ because if
;;;                   attention goes back to one of these "old" locations the
;;;                   "old" location chunk reports as attended t in the current
;;;                   module, but it was attended nil in all past versions.
;;;             : [ ] Fix the add/delete/update-visicon-item code to work right
;;;                   when deleteing visicon chunks and test-feats is true.
;;;                   Pretty low priority since most people use add/delete/update
;;;                   for performance and test-feats can have a noticeable cost.
;;;             : [X] There is no feat-table now! 
;;;                   Should the feat-table be purged other than on a clear, for
;;;                   instance if an object goes away without a clear?
;;;             : [ ] Does test-feats do the right thing in enter-into-visicon
;;;                   with respect to checking the real-visual-value i.e. does
;;;                   that always get set correctly elsewhere or can that break
;;;                   with a custom device?
;;; 
;;; ----- History ----- [look also at function comments]
;;;
;;; 2007.05.23 Dan 
;;;             : * Start of a rewrite to use chunks internally for the visicon
;;;             :   and as the objects themselves.
;;;             : * Will work in conjunction with updated device interface, devices,
;;;             :   and motor (mouse cursor stuff) files.
;;; 2007.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * Works in the abstract case at this point (modeler supplied
;;;             :   device which handles everything explicitly).
;;;             : * Took the nearest slot out of visual-locations and made it
;;;             :   a request parameter - should have happened in the old system
;;;             :   long ago...
;;;             : * Also took the userprop slots out and put height and width in.
;;; 2007.07.05 Dan
;;;             : * Modified visicon-chunks to sort based on x-y coordinates to
;;;             :   provide more consistency across platforms/Lisps since the
;;;             :   visicon hash-table doesn't maintain the entry order.  It's
;;;             :   a slight performance hit, but consistency in the tutorial 
;;;             :   and elsewhere is worth it (for now at least, and it could
;;;             :   be put onto a parameter to check if people don't like it).
;;; 2007.07.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added a default case to icon-entry to just return the
;;;             :   chunks explicit chunk-visicon-entry value when the "matching"
;;;             :   process fails (fixes a bug in re-encoding of the screen when
;;;             :   a "close" but new object is the one that gets re-encoded).
;;; 2007.07.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added the text-feats function even though it's not really
;;;             :   needed yet...
;;; 2007.07.09 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug when move tolerance was 0.0 - needed to add
;;;             :   a couple chunk-visicion-entry calls around chunk names in a
;;;             :   couple of places to make sure the "right" chunk was being
;;;             :   referenced.
;;; 2007.07.12 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with the move-attention requests.  It didn't
;;;             :   verify that the chunk for the screen-pos was of type visual-
;;;             :   location before sending it off for further processing.
;;; 2007.10.04 Dan
;;;             : * Added the pieces to handle the "special" processing of
;;;             :   text items into sub-features (:optimize-visual nil), and
;;;             :   the processing of scale {phrase or word} in the move-attention
;;;             :   requests for text items.
;;;             : * Updated the version to a2.
;;; 2007.11.01 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed bugs in attend-visual-coordinates and enter-into-visicon.
;;; 2007.11.16 Dan
;;;             : * Added a check of moving-atteniton to the drop-out check for
;;;             :   update-attended-loc.
;;; 2007.12.11 Dan
;;;             : * Added the randomizing of times for the reencoding events.
;;;             :   That was a bug introduced in the 5->6 transition.
;;; 2007.12.17 Dan
;;;             : * Finished first pass at adding the tracking code in.
;;;             :   It works with either the old "screen-obj" style mechanism
;;;             :   (though that's now depricated) or through the visual-location
;;;             :   feature chunk (must return the same location chunk to move
;;;             :   the item for the model).
;;; 2007.12.18 Dan
;;;             : * Clean-up of the tracking code to fix some of the cases
;;;             :   that weren't signaled or handled correctly.
;;; 2007.12.19 Dan
;;;             : * Minor fix for update-tracking-mth - make sure vis-loc-to-obj
;;;             :   called with the current device or object as needed.
;;; 2007.12.20 Dan
;;;             : * Changed object-present-p to not do the chunk testing for
;;;             :   checking for a similar object because it prevented some
;;;             :   re-encodings that should have happened.  (Also see the note
;;;             :   under bugs above.)
;;; 2007.12.21 Dan
;;;             : * Changed find-current-locs-with-spec to catch the case where
;;;             :   :nearest current is specified but there isn't yet a currently
;;;             :   attended location.  To be backward compatible it assumes 0,0
;;;             :   and prints a warning about it.
;;; 2008.01.07 Dan
;;;             : * Added merging functions for visicon-entry, visual-object, and
;;;             :   real-visual-value chunk parameters so that the new chunk's
;;;             :   values are set in the merged chunk.  Vision needs the newest
;;;             :   info available to properly align with the visicon and current
;;;             :   device...
;;; 2008.01.09 Dan
;;;             : * To maintain the determinism of things the chunks to be
;;;             :   stuffed are first sorted by name before a random one is 
;;;             :   picked.  Shouldn't be too much of a performance hit and
;;;             :   it's needed if the test models are to always produce the
;;;             :   same traces.
;;; 2008.01.16 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in icon-entry that could throw a warning if the
;;;             :   visual-location being used in an attention shift hadn't 
;;;             :   orignially come from the vision module.
;;; 2008.01.31 Dan
;;;             : * Added in a version of the add-screen-object and delete-screen-object
;;;             :   commands for those that used them in the old module.  The
;;;             :   delete method differs from the old version in that it takes
;;;             :   the same object as add does.
;;; 2008.02.14 Dan
;;;             : * Adding a new request to the visual-location buffer - set-visloc-default.
;;;             :   That allows the model to configure the buffer stuffing test as
;;;             :   would be done with the set-visloc-default command without needing
;;;             :   to resort to a !eval!.
;;;             : * Re-fixed a bug that got lost somewhere along the way!
;;;             :   find-current-locs-with-spec mis-tested :attended.
;;;             :   Was fixed on 2007.12.07 (it's in the commit logs) but that
;;;             :   change and note isn't here now so somewhere along the way
;;;             :   I modified and committed an old version...
;;;             : * Added some more saftey tests to set-visloc-default command.
;;; 2008.02.14 Dan [3.0b1]
;;;             : * Corrected an oversight in the visual-location matching.
;;;             :   The value slot wasn't being compared to the "real" visual
;;;             :   value for something like text where the visual-location
;;;             :   chunk's value isn't the same as what print-visicon shows.
;;;             :   Thus, unlike the old version of the module, requests like
;;;             :   this wouldn't work as expected prior to this fix:
;;;             :   +visual-location> isa visual-location value "a"
;;;             :   for "standard" text display items because the default operation 
;;;             :   for text items is to set the value slot to text in the 
;;;             :   visual-location chunk and that's what the comparison was using.
;;;             :   Now, when the chunk-real-visual-value parameter is set, that's
;;;             :   what gets used for the value slot tests.
;;; 2008.02.15 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remove-finst function since update-cursor-feat 
;;;             :   called it!
;;; 2008.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the priority on the set-visloc-default request
;;;             :   action that gets scheduled to have a value of 9 which puts
;;;             :   it just below the implicit buffer clearing due to the 
;;;             :   request.  That makes it very unlikely that a cooccuring
;;;             :   proc-display will sneak in between the clearing of the 
;;;             :   buffer and the changing of the defaults and thus stuff
;;;             :   an "unwanted" chunk in there.  It could avoid that by
;;;             :   scheduling the priority higher than the clear, but I don't
;;;             :   think that's a good practice in general.
;;; 2008.03.21 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in test-attended because it assumed the chunk
;;;             :   for which the attended status was being checked was still
;;;             :   a valid member of the visicon.  Brings up a question which
;;;             :   I've added under bugs - what's the right status for such
;;;             :   a chunk?  Should it just always "fail" the query?  
;;;             : * A related question the test model brought up is what 
;;;             :   about when there are "overlapping" features - should they
;;;             :   share a finst?
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with enter-into-visicon because it didn't
;;;             :   consider the "real" value of the items when eliminating
;;;             :   possible duplicates.
;;; 2008.03.31 Dan
;;;             : * Changed visicon-chunks so that it has an optional parameter
;;;             :   which indicates when to sort things.  Only using that for
;;;             :   the print-visicon command and find-location requests now to 
;;;             :   improve performance and still maintain the "cross platform"
;;;             :   consistency.
;;; 2008.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added add-visicon-item and delete-visicon-item as more
;;;             :   "user" level equivalents of add-screen-object and delete-...
;;;             :   because they don't require passing the vision module itself
;;;             :   as a parameter.  Otherwise they're the same commands.
;;; 2008.04.07 Dan
;;;             : * Added an automatic call to stuff-visloc-buffer when a
;;;             :   set-visloc-default request is made to trigger any possible 
;;;             :   stuffing based on the new settings. 
;;;             : * Adding a new parameter :auto-attend.
;;;             :   When it is set to t (defaults to nil) it will cause the 
;;;             :   vision module to automatically start a move-attention after
;;;             :   a successful visual-location request completes to attend
;;;             :   to that visual-location.
;;;             :   Basically it's a modeling shortcut for simple situations
;;;             :   where the result of the visual-location request aren't
;;;             :   that important and one is just going to attend it anyway.
;;;             :   Saves some productions in the model but doesn't affect the
;;;             :   timing because the request is delayed 50ms to compensate for 
;;;             :   the skipped production.
;;;             :   The module is not marked as busy during the 50ms delay.  So
;;;             :   one should be careful about using explicit move-attention
;;;             :   requests when this parameter is enabled.  The assumption is
;;;             :   that you won't be using explicit requests if you turn this
;;;             :   option on.
;;; 2008.04.08 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with re-encoding - it didn't mark the chunk
;;;             :   being set into the buffer as unrequested.  Now it does.
;;; 2008.04.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new parameter :test-feats which can allow for some
;;;             :   significant improvements in run time for proc-display calls
;;;             :   if it is set to nil (the default value is t).  There are 
;;;             :   limited situations where one can safely set it to nil:
;;;             :   - All proc-display calls specify :clear t
;;;             :   - If each visual item in the device returns the "same" chunk 
;;;             :     from build-vis-locs-for every time (by same it means same 
;;;             :     name though the contents could differ)
;;;             :   The next step is to update the built in devices so that 
;;;             :   they satisfy the second situation and thus work correctly
;;;             :   with the parameter set to nil.
;;; 2008.05.22 Dan
;;;             : * Added a warning to add-finst since it can be called by the
;;              :   model through an assign-finst request with a "bad" value.
;;; 2008.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the -fct from slot-specs-to-chunk-spec-list and
;;;             :   slot-specs-to-chunk-spec since the macros were removed from 
;;;             :   the chunk-spec code.
;;; 2008.07.02 Dan [3.0b2]
;;;             : * Added code to delete the "internal" visicon chunks when a
;;;             :   proc-display occurs.
;;;             :   Requires locking the device during visual-location buffer
;;;             :   settings to avoid possible deletion of a chunk that hasn't
;;;             :   yet been copied for the buffer.
;;; 2008.07.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue when test-feats was t that overlapping text
;;;             :   could persist - the old icon entry may stick around when 
;;;             :   :clear t not given to proc-display.
;;; 2008.07.15 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the output setting for find-loc-failure so that it
;;;             :   prints in the low detail trace.
;;; 2008.07.22 Dan
;;;             : * Fixing the overlapping text issue on the 14th re-introduced
;;;             :   a bug where overlapping text items with different values
;;;             :   were "merged" into one feature.  Re-fixed that issue.
;;; 2008.07.24 Dan
;;;             : * Adding yet another parameter  - :delete-visicon-chunks.
;;;             :   Defaults to t, and when on the visicon chunks get purged
;;;             :   during proc-display.
;;; 2008.08.11 Dan [3.0b3]
;;;             : * Adding a new query to the module to allow one to detect
;;;             :   visual changes other than through the visual-location buffer
;;;             :   stuffing. 
;;;             :   
;;;             :   There's a new parameter called :scene-change-threshold
;;;             :   and if during a proc-display the computed change equals
;;;             :   or exceeds that setting the scene-change query of the visual
;;;             :   buffer will go true.
;;;             :   It will stay true for a time equal to the :visual-onset-span 
;;;             :   value.
;;;             :   It can also be explicitly cleared by using the new request
;;;             :   which takes no parameters and no time:
;;;             :     +visual>
;;;             :       isa clear-scene-change
;;;             :   It is also cleared with the existing clear request:
;;;             :     +visual>
;;;             :       isa clear 
;;;             :   The change computation is computed as a proportion of
;;;             :   items which differ between the two sets and the setting of the 
;;;             :   :scene-change-threshold must be a value in the range 0.0-1.0.
;;;             :   
;;;             :   Here's the computation used to determine the change value:
;;;             :   
;;;             :   ov = the set of items in the visicon when proc-display called.
;;;             :   o  = the number of items in ov.
;;;             :   d  = number of items from ov not in the new visicon.
;;;             :   n  = number of items in the new visicon which were not in ov.
;;;             :   
;;;             :   change = (d+n)/(o+n)
;;;             :   
;;;             :   If o and n are both 0 then the change is 0.    
;;; 2008.08.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new query for the visual buffer: scene-change-value.
;;;             :   It's mostly there as a debugging aid to show what the last
;;;             :   scene-change proprotion was through the buffer-status 
;;;             :   command.  However, it can be queried normally.  The value
;;;             :   given should be a number.  If the last scene-change had a
;;;             :   proportion of change greater than that value the query will
;;;             :   respond as true.  It does not time out like the scene-change
;;;             :   query does (after the onset span time).
;;; 2009.03.31 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Seems stable enough now to take the beta version off...
;;;             : * Added a hash-table based compare mechanism like DM uses for
;;;             :   fast-merging to the process-display code.  About the same
;;;             :   speed-wise for small (0~15) displays, but significantly
;;;             :   faster as they get larger.
;;;             : * Added a new command remove-visual-finsts since people have 
;;;             :   been using proc-display :clear t to do that even without
;;;             :   "changing" the display.
;;;             : * Fixed a bug related to "proc-display :clear t" - when the
;;;             :   same chunks were returned by the build-vis-locs-for method(s)
;;;             :   as it had previously any finsts on those items may have
;;;             :   persisted once the item was no longer "new" again.
;;; 2009.04.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added a check to see if there's a lock set in stuff-visloc-
;;;             :   buffer so it doesn't try to add more than one item at a time.
;;;             :   It was already setting and clearing a lock, but just wasn't
;;;             :   testing for it...
;;; 2009.04.29 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the phrase parsing so that the phrase! chunk gets a 
;;;             :   color based on the majority color among the individual words.
;;;             :   Also added a colors slot to hold the list of item colors
;;;             :   corresponding to the words and objects slots.
;;; 2009.08.27 Dan
;;;             : * Changed visicon-update so that it has an optional parameter
;;;             :   to determine whether or not it needs to count the visicon 
;;;             :   items for return.
;;;             : * Modified delete-screen-object (and thus delete-visicon-item)
;;;             :   so that the internal chunk gets purged if :delete-visicon-chunks
;;;             :   is true.
;;; 2009.08.28 Dan
;;;             : * Added optional update parameters to the internal add-screen-object
;;;             :   and delete-screen-object and the user commands add-visicon-item
;;;             :   and delete-visicon-item so that multiple adds & deletes can avoid
;;;             :   all having to run the updating code.  One benefit to that is that 
;;;             :   it won't always be the first item added to the screen that gets 
;;;             :   stuffed if one doesn't want that.
;;;             : * Added an update-visicon-item command to go along with the 
;;;             :   add- and delete- ones.  It has a required parameter of the object
;;;             :   an optional parameter for updating (like add and delete now have)
;;;             :   and two possible keword parameters :same-chunks and :chunks.
;;;             :   It works in one of three ways based on which if any of the 
;;;             :   keyword parameters are provided (if the parameters are invalid
;;;             :   then it just prints a warning and does nothing):
;;;             :
;;;             :   - If neither is given then it does the same thing as if the object 
;;;             :   had been deleted and then added again.
;;;             :
;;;             :   - If :chunks is non-nil and is either a symbol naming a chunk or a 
;;;             :   list of chunk names all of which correspond to the chunk(s) that
;;;             :   were originally added to the visicon for the object with add-visicon-
;;;             :   item then it will update the module's internal representation of 
;;;             :   those features.
;;;             :
;;;             :   - If :chunks is nil but :same-chunks is t then it will call 
;;;             :   build-vis-locs-for for that object and treat the list of chunks
;;;             :   that are returned the same as if the :chunks parameter had been
;;;             :   given with that list.
;;;             :
;;;             :   One note on using update-visicon-item is that you must set :test-feats
;;;             :   to nil for now otherwise it will not work.  That means if you want
;;;             :   overlapping duplicate features removed you will have to handle that
;;;             :   explicitly outside of the module.
;;; 2009.08.31 Dan
;;;             : * Added more warnings since delete-visicon-item also has a potential
;;;             :   issue with test-feats if it's set to purge chunks.
;;; 2009.11.18 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with a '(lambda ...)  in synthesize-phrase
;;;             :   because LispWorks doesn't like that construct.
;;; 2010.02.04 Dan
;;;             : * Make sure tracking keeps a finst on something tracked for 
;;;             :   longer than the finst duration time.
;;; 2010.02.12 Dan
;;;             : * Let a move-attention break tracking without having to
;;;             :   explicitly clear it first.  The issue was that tracking 
;;;             :   keeps the module busy so the move-attention would jam, but
;;;             :   now it ignores that jam if it's due to tracking.
;;; 2010.02.18 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug which could cause problems with a device that
;;;             :   was modifying the chunks for its features prior to a 
;;;             :   proc-display call.  Within-move was returning the original
;;;             :   chunk and not the internal copy and featlis-to-chunks was
;;;             :   using that orignial chunk to set the icon-entry for the
;;;             :   object.  Now within-move uses the internal copy and featlis-to-
;;;             :   chunks gets the appropriate visicon-entry from that.
;;; 2010.02.19 Dan
;;;             : * Modified featlis-to-focus and determine-focus-dmo to go
;;;             :   along with the last couple of fixes to make sure everything
;;;             :   stays in sync.
;;; 2010.03.02 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with featlis-to-focus that could cause problems
;;;             :   when an attended item leaves the screen.
;;; 2010.03.25 Dan
;;;             : * Added a purge-chunk to enter-into-visicon for those which
;;;             :   already existed in the table since they wouldn't have been
;;;             :   purged previously.
;;; 2010.04.30 Dan
;;;             : * Adjusted how :auto-attend works to now mark the module as
;;;             :   busy from the time of the find-location all the way through
;;;             :   the encoding-complete.
;;;             : * Also added an event to show in the trace and make sure that
;;;             :   it is using the buffer's chunk and not the internal chunk
;;;             :   to avoid problems with deleting visicon chunks.
;;; 2010.05.03 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the :output of the "No visual-object found" event
;;;             :   from 'high to 'medium since that's how it has always printed
;;;             :   anyway because of a bug in filter-test.
;;; 2010.08.03 Dan
;;;             : * Changed update-tracking-loc-chunk to also set the current-marker
;;;             :   so that the focus ring updates as the model tracks the item.
;;;             : * Also set current-marker in update-tracking-mth because there
;;;             :   could be a model issue that prevents update-tracing-loc-chunk
;;;             :   from being called (cases 6, 7, 8, and 9).
;;;             : * Don't set the object's screen-pos slot in update-tracking-mth
;;;             :   now except in the cases where it won't get set via update-tracking-loc-chunk.
;;;             :   That prevents an issue with deleting that visicion chunk 
;;;             :   later in most cases.  May want to not set it at all in those
;;;             :   cases.
;;; 2011.01.19 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the attended querying so that chunks which aren't
;;;             :   part of the visicon now may still report that they are
;;;             :   attended nil instead of having all the attended queries fail
;;;             :   as was done previously and noted in the todo.  This differs
;;;             :   from the old vision because the old one only allowed the attended
;;;             :   tests for chunks which came from vision at some point -- thus
;;;             :   arbitrary locations would have been in the all queries fail
;;;             :   situation which the new version no longer has.  Neither however
;;;             :   addresses issue of attention "returning".
;;;             : * Depricating update-tracking now in preparation for fixing some
;;;             :   of the lingering finst/object issues in tracking.
;;;             : * Added unlock-tracking since unlock-device used to call
;;;             :   update-tracking.
;;;             : * Changed update-tracking-mth to account for the fact that things
;;;             :   should always be valid when it starts which avoids some warnings
;;;             :   and problems that used to happen when it tried to update an
;;;             :   'object' on the fly.
;;;             : * Update-attended-loc schedules it's state change so that the
;;;             :   buffer trace will always catch it.
;;; 2011.02.04 Dan [3.1]
;;;             : * A reworking of how the visicon gets maintained with respect to
;;;             :   recording features.  Instead of two tables, one for feature
;;;             :   comparison and one for the visicon, there's only a visicon
;;;             :   table and the keys are the feature lists when :test-feats is
;;;             :   set to t, otherwise the device's loc chunk is the key.
;;;             : * Fixes some issues with re-attending for an object that moves.
;;;             : * Update cursor doesn't modify the existing feature anymore
;;;             :   and instead just creates a new one.
;;;             : * Find-current-loc-with-spec now uses the real-visual-value
;;;             :   value of the "current" when 'value current' is requested if
;;;             :   there is such a value.
;;;             : * Added a new chunk parameter visual-feature-name since the
;;;             :   visicon-entry can now be a list of features instead of the
;;;             :   device's chunk name.
;;;             : * Updated the synth-feat code so that the colors get set
;;;             :   based on the majority color of the lower level when :optimize-
;;;             :   visual is nil too.
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with how the features are marked for a phrase
;;;             :   when optimize-visual is nil.
;;; 2011.03.28 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with how current-marker gets set during tracking.
;;; 2011.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Very minor change to tracking code to avoid an unnecessary
;;;             :   copy.
;;; 2011.04.26 Dan
;;;             : * Changed finst and new/change values to use the ms timing.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Added a declaim to avoid a compiler warning about an
;;;             :   undefined function and added some declares to ignore unused
;;;             :   variables.
;;;             : * Suppress the warnings about extending the chunks.
;;; 2011.05.16 Dan
;;;             : * Replaced pm-warning calls with model-warning.
;;; 2011.11.09 Dan
;;;             : * Commented out the *enable-package-locked-errors* line for ACL 
;;;             :   because it no longer seems to be necessary and it sets up a 
;;;             :   dangerous situation for users since that setting enables the
;;;             :   redefinition of CL functions without warning.
;;;             : * Added a new function add-word-characters which allows the 
;;;             :   user to modify how text strings get broken into "words" 
;;;             :   by specifying additional characters to include in sequences 
;;;             :   along with those that are alphanumericp.
;;; 2011.11.14 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new request parameter to visual-location requests
;;;             :   and two additional options for the :nearest specification.
;;;             :   The new :nearest options are clockwise and counterclockwise.
;;;             :   That is computed relative to a center point specified
;;;             :   by the new request parameter :center which should be either
;;;             :   a visual-location or visual-object.  If :center is not 
;;;             :   specified then the default center point is used which is
;;;             :   0,0 but can be changed with the set-visual-center-point 
;;;             :   command (note that open-exp-window will automatically set
;;;             :   the visual center point to the center of the window it opens).
;;;             : * Added current-x, current-y, clockwise, and counterclockwise
;;;             :   to the set of pm-constant chunks the module creates.
;;; 2011.12.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added a string< test to loc-sort so that when the x and y
;;;             :   coordinates are the same there's still a consistent sorting
;;;             :   to the features.
;;; 2012.01.24 Dan
;;;             : * Added a warning to process-display to note that it should
;;;             :   not be called more than once at a time because that can cause 
;;;             :   issues with the re-attending, but since people may be using
;;;             :   that as a hack to force a particular chunk to buffer stuff
;;;             :   in the vis-loc buffer it's a model warning so it can be
;;;             :   turned off.
;;; 2012.01.25 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the order in which the events are scheduled in 
;;;             :   update-attended-loc because it can affect when the next
;;;             :   conflict-resolution occurs.  This doesn't address the
;;;             :   bigger issue, but it at least fixes the only such case I
;;;             :   could find in the default modules.
;;; 2012.02.15 Dan
;;;             : * Added some code to avoid a warning about not having a current
;;;             :   location when one isn't really needed anyway.
;;; 2012.06.26 Dan
;;;             : * The currently-attended and current-marker are both cleared 
;;;             :   if the model processes a new device to avoid re-encoding
;;;             :   something from the new window that happens to be at the
;;;             :   same coordinates as the item last attended in the previous
;;;             :   device.
;;; 2012.06.29 Dan
;;;             : * Added gray as one of the default color chunks.
;;; 2012.08.09 Dan
;;;             : * The state change for update-attended-loc now happens both
;;;             :   immediately and in an event to avoid issues with multiple
;;;             :   simultaneous updates and to still allow for proper recording
;;;             :   of the state transitions.
;;; 2012.12.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added xyz-loc to get the vector of screen-x, screen-y, and
;;;             :   distance. 
;;;             : * Use xyz-loc in the nearest calculation so that distance 
;;;             :   matters too (doesn't change anything for default 2D devices).
;;; 2013.07.24 Dan
;;;             : * Added a run-time warning if a move-attention request doesn't
;;;             :   have a screen-pos value.
;;; 2013.10.02 Dan
;;;             : * Commented out the optimize proclaim since that persists and
;;;             :   may or may not be useful anyway.
;;; 2013.10.14 Dan

;;;
;;; General description of update
;;;
;;; The idea is to take advantage of the capabilities in ACT-R 6 to use chunks
;;; for the visicon.  Replace build-features-for with build-vis-locs-for that just 
;;; needs to return a list of chunks which can be subtypes of visual-location.  That 
;;; allows the modeler more freedom in representation.  Along with that, the "find-
;;; location" requests will now use the full power of the general chunk matcher which 
;;; means that slots can be specified any number of times and variables will
;;; be available that would allow for something like saying "find a location where
;;; the x and y coordinates are the same" or "find a location where the width
;;; is greater than the height".
;;;
;;; Along with that will be a corresponding shift from feat-to-dmo to vis-loc-to-obj 
;;; which again will shift toward returning the chunk representation directly.
;;; 
;;; It should be completely backward compatible with existing models, but not
;;; with existing devices or code that takes advantage of "hidden" features of
;;; the vision module (some undocumented capabilities like attn-trace have been
;;; removed to simplify the support code, but if people really need those they
;;; can be restored later).
;;;
;;; This does sacrifice a lot of the OO functionality for features and specs,
;;; but my observation is that many  users aren't taking advantage of that 
;;; now and in fact some don't want to bother with it to the point that they 
;;; implement a complete replacement module for vision instead of creating a new 
;;; device to use (yes, really)!  The hope is that by making it chunk based it will 
;;; be more accessible to the average user without giving up too much that the 
;;; advanced user relies on.
;;;
;;; Because it's going to be less restrictive in terms of the find-locations that
;;; it can do there is the the possibility of abusing the system in a "super-human"
;;; way, but that's an issue in other parts of the system as well and one of those
;;; things that the modeler will have to consider his/her own feelings of 
;;; what's plausible.  Basically, the idea is that the tool is very flexible
;;; and it's up to the users to determine how best to use it for their purposes.

#|

Proposed new ACT-R 6 mechanism to properly deal with buffer issues:

Then, whenever there's a change to the display the buffers
will be updated as follows:

   First, if the build-features-for returns nil then assume
   that the tracked object is out of sight now.  As with an
   encoding failure, clear visual and set the error state also
   stop the tracking.


   If both buffers are empty:

   A new location is created and the object is modified
   to have that as its screen-pos.  Both chunks (the
   new loc. and the object) are stuffed into the buffers.

  If vis-loc empty, visual holds the tracked item:

   Create a new location chunk and stuff it into
   the visual-location buffer.  Modify the chunk in the
   visual buffer to have that screen-pos.

  vis-loc holds tracked item's loc. and visual is empty:

   Modify the chunk in the visual-location buffer with
   the new info and put the object back into the visual
   buffer (it shouldn't have to be modified at all since
   its loc. is in the vis-loc buffer.

  both buffers hold the appropriate chunks:

   Modify the chunk in the visual-location buffer,
   no other changes necessary.

  If either buffer holds a chunk that isn't related
  to the tracked item:

   Make the appropriate updates to the underlying chunks
   as needed (modify the chunk in the buffer if it's
   the tracked one or create/modify the internal one)
   but don't overwrite a non-tracked chunk in the
   buffer.

;;;             : associated screen object, and some way of determining the width 
;;;             : (in pixels) of a string.  May also provide a function for 
;;;             : computing a different starting x coordinate for each line.

;;;             : There are two ways to do it, with and without optimizing. 
;;;             : With optimizing it's easy, just accumulate words.  When
;;;             : optimzing is off, though, have to walk the string
;;;             : character-by-character and build features for each one.
