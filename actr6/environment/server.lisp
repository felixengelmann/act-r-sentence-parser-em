;;; Description : Contains no system dependent code because it relies on the

;;;             : Holds the Environment global variables and the
;;;             : code to open and manage an environment socket connection. 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;; 
;;; Todo        : Reconstruct why all the error trapping ignores the
;;;             : unbound-variable errors because that's a bad thing
;;;             : for the stand-alone version...

;;; ----- History -----
;;;
;;; 05/10/2002  Dan
;;;             : Added this header
;;; 05/20/2002  Dan
;;;             : Think I've finally got it working on Macs w/ OS < 10 and MCL
;;;             : and for now w/OSX it's got to be OpenMcl which also seems
;;;             : to work (though it's not in here yet...)
;;; 05/21/2002  Dan
;;;             : Serious reorganization took place with the files...
;;; 05/22/2002  Dan
;;;             : Fixed some more MCL problems.  At this point it's working
;;;             : mostly, so I'm not wasting any more time 'fixing' it there
;;;             : since MacOS < 10 is "dead"...
;;;             : Changed close-connection so that killing the process was
;;;             : optional and altered the message-process and process-
;;;             : connection functions so that they don't kill their own
;;;             : process (doesn't seem to change things, but seemed like a
;;;             : good idea and I thought it'd fix a closeing bug I had
;;;             : in MCL, but it didn't).
;;; 05/23/2002  Dan
;;;             : Made a very subtle change, that may have a big impact
;;;             : later on.  When a handler is created it preforms an initial
;;;             : update - that's as it was, but now that first time the
;;;             : handler itself is passed as the parameter to the updater.
;;;             : Thus if an updater needs to use its parameter it had better
;;;             : check its type because that first time it'll be something
;;;             : other than it normally expects.
;;; 08/23/2002  Dan
;;;             : Updated the version number to 6.0b3, which doesn't 
;;;             : correspond to the versions in the headers, so I
;;;             : need to fix that at some point for consistency...
;;; 09/17/2002  Dan
;;;             : Updated the environment and ACT-R version numbers...
;;; 10/01/2002  Dan
;;;             : Updated version to 1.1 and fixed the packaging
;;;             : for building a standalone in ACL.
;;;             : Added the conditionalized in-package to message-process
;;;             : to make building a standalone easier.
;;;             : Changed the environment version to correspond to the
;;;             : file version numbers and add a -S if it's the standalone.
;;; 01/20/2003  Dan
;;;             : Updated version number again for the env because
;;;             : of a quick change for the class.
;;; 07/07/2003  Dan
;;;             : Updated version because I rolled in most of Mike's newest
;;;             : RPM (my UWI and ACL device files were newer).
;;; 08/15/2003  Dan
;;;             : Updated version to 1.3 because I've added the support for
;;;             : CMUCL from Ethan Glasser-Camp at RPI.
;;; 12/19/2003  Dan
;;;             : Updated version to 1.4 for this file because I've fixed
;;;             : a bug in the uni-files and moved the ACT-R version
;;;             : variable to the actr5.lisp file itself.
;;; 4/22/2004   Dan [1.5]
;;;             : Added the license info, updated the version to 1.5
;;;             : and removed the ACT-R version variable since that's
;;;             : in the main ACT-R file now.
;;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; 2005.04.11  Dan [2.0]
;;;             : Start of the move to ACT-R 6.0.
;;; 2007.08.03  Dan
;;;             : * Moved the *environment-sockets* defvar to env-module
;;;             :   to avoid a compiler warning.
;;; 2007.08.13  Dan
;;;             : * Adding reset as a possible update condtion for handlers.
;;; 2007.08.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added a without-interrupts call to close-connection to
;;;             :   fix a problem in stopping things under LispWorks.
;;; 2008.01.15 Dan
;;;             : * Changed close-connection because SBCL doesn't have
;;;             :   without-interrupts in the default package...
;;; 2008.04.08 Dan
;;;             : * Refixed that last update using uni-without-interrupts.
;;;             :   Also added the require-compiled of uni-files just to be
;;;             :   safe.
;;; 2008.05.16 Dan
;;;             : * Added the conflict-nil option for when to update the
;;;             :   handler.  That's the same as conflict except that it 
;;;             :   doesn't pass the return value back to the conflict-set-
;;;             :   hook.
;;; 2009.01.08 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with message-process which could cause
;;;             :   problems with some Lisps (CCLx86 in particular).
;;; 2009.04.13  Dan
;;;             : * Uni-send-string doesn't have an automatic newline now,
;;;             :   so need to put one in the string to be sent.
;;; 2009.04.14  Dan
;;;             : * Seems that adding the newline here breaks the stopping
;;;             :   of the connection.  However, since it doesn't seem to be 
;;;             :   necessary I'm just dropping it again.
;;; 2009.06.08  Dan
;;;             : * Adding the run-environment command which spawns the
;;;             :   environment app and then makes the connection.
;;;             :   Only available for LispWorks under MacOSX or Windows and
;;;             :   ACL under MacOSX or Windows at this time.
;;; 2009.06.09 Dan
;;;             : * Upped the default delay on run-environment to 12 seconds
;;;             :   to be safer.
;;; 2009.07.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added a test to the remove handler code so that it 
;;;             :   shouldn't throw an error on initial connection anymore
;;;             :   like it would occasionally for some Lisps.
;;; 2011.01.07 Dan
;;;             : * Lock all the background processes from the environment
;;;             :   for now until I come up with a better way to protect the
;;;             :   ACT-R code.
;;; 2011.01.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the name of the application to run for the Mac
;;;             :   environment in the ACL run-environment command.
;;; 2011.01.14 Dan
;;;             : * Added a return reply for the keep alive message to 
;;;             :   possibly avoid some time out issues in Windows 7.
;;; 2011.02.21 Dan 
;;;             : * Added the ability to specify the new run-start and run-end hooks.
;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; 2011.05.20 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Start of a complete overhaul to eliminate most of the 
;;;             :   global variable usage and better encapsulate things so
;;;             :   that multiple model support can be added.
;;; 2011.05.25 Dan 
;;;             : * Updated create message parsing to set the use-model 
;;;             :   slot.  The semantics now are that if there are only 6
;;;             :   items in the create no model is used, if there are 7 then
;;;             :   the 7th is either a model name to use when evaluating the
;;;             :   update or nil which means use the current-model explicitly
;;;             :   (which is not the same as not using a model).
;;;             : * Added the which-hook slot to the control structure and
;;;             :   set that in the hook updating functions.
;;; 2011.05.26 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a cut-and-paste error in delete-post-hook-if-necessary.
;;; 2011.06.01 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the remove message handling to only evaluate it in
;;;             :   a model if that's a valid model now.
;;; 2011.09.02 Dan
;;;             : * Added a background option to connect-to-environment so
;;;             :   that it's possible to have the environment message handling
;;;             :   thread be the main one (for use with standalone versions that
;;;             :   have a slave Lisp running headless).
;;; 2011.09.07 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed some format strings that were missing '~'s.
;;; 2011.09.13 Dan
;;;             : * Readjust how the default run-environment gets defined to
;;;             :   avoid a warning for multiple definitions.
;;; 2011.11.07 Dan
;;;             : * Added a check for LW 6 to the windows version of run-
;;;             :   environment so it'll work there too.
;;; 2011.12.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added some checks to start-environment so it better warns
;;;             :   when the Lisp isn't able to use the Environment.
;;; 2012.02.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added some more declaims to avoid undefined function warnings
;;;             :   at load time.
;;; 2012.02.07 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the declaim for update-handler.
;;; 2012.03.21 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with stopping the environment while the stepper
;;;             :   was open that prevented one from using the stepper if a
;;;             :   new environment connection was made.
;;; 2012.09.07 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the in-package from message-process based on the
;;;             :   :actr-env-alone feature.
;;; 2012.09.21 Dan
;;;             : * Trying to eliminate an intermittent environment error
;;;             :   with multiple models in CCL (perhaps elsewhere too just
;;;             :   unreported).  So adding additional lock-outs so that 
;;;             :   updates can't occur while the model is running by locking
;;;             :   during the pre-event-hook and unlocking during the post as
;;;             :   well as during anything else which calls update handlers.
;;;             : * The problem with that is if someone breaks the system
;;;             :   between pre and post it leaves the lock set and basically
;;;             :   kills the environment -- need a better alternative.
;;; 2013.02.22 Dan
;;;             : * Added the wait-for-environment command to provide a way
;;;             :   to check that it has processed all outstanding actions.
;;;             :   Primary intended use is with creating complex visible
;;;             :   virtual displays, especially those that update faster than 
;;;             :   real time, because if the "drawing" falls behind things
;;;             :   can be difficult to use or display errors could result.
;;; 2013.02.25 Dan
;;;             : * Adding run-environment commands for CCL in Win, Mac, and
;;;             :   linux.
;;;             : * Changed how the delay parameter works for run-environment.
;;;             :   It still waits that long before the first try to connect,
;;;             :   but it will now continue to try to connect after every 
;;;             :   delay seconds pass.
;;; 2013.02.26 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with the CCL Mac run-environment.
;;; 2013.12.18 Dan
;;;             : * Changed close-connection so that there's a parameter which
;;;             :   indcates whether or not to send the close message.
;;;             : * Changed the reception of a goodbye message so that it 
;;;             :   completely closes down the connection by killing the 
;;;             :   process as well.
