;;; Filename    : uniform-interface-virtual.lisp
;;; Version     : 1.0a1
;;; 
;;; Description : wirtual view functions to implement the UWI.
;;;             : NOTE: The UWI is only still around to support the 
;;;             :       ACT-R GUI interface. I don't advocate using it directly.      
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;; --- History ---
;;; 2002.06.30 Dan
;;;             : Added this header.
;;;             : Moved all of the UWI code from virtual-view 
;;;             : to this file where it belongs.
;;;             : Added the visible-virtuals-avaialable? function.
;;;             : Actually documented the code and added defgenerics with
;;;             : documentation for the uwi.
;;; 2002.12.19 Dan
;;;             : Modified make-static-text-for-rpm-window to take a
;;;             : color parameter.
;;; 04.04.13 Dan [2.2] (previous change is "new" as of 2.2 as well)
;;;             : Changed the copyright notice and added the LGPL stuff.
;;;
;;; 04.10.19 Dan [Moved into ACT-R 6]
;;;             : Reset the version to 1.0a1
;;;             : added the packaging switches
;;; 2007.07.13 Dan
;;;             : * Adding color as an option for button items in make-
;;;                 button-for
;;; 2008.07.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added code so that closing a virtual window will force all
;;;             :   the associated chunks to be purged:
;;;             :    -  closing a virtual window will first remove all of its
;;;             :       objects.
;;;             :    -  if it has a loc-chunk (a cursor) it is purged.
;;; 2012.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * The loc-chunk slot now holds a hash-table since multiple
;;;             :   models could be sharing the window and each will have its
;;;             :   own cursor chunk.
;;; 2012.10.02 Dan
;;;             : * Make-rpm-window now uses print warning to report when there
;;;             :   isn't a visible window available when one is requested and
;;;             :   returns a virtual on instead.
;;; 2013.01.10 Dan
;;;             : * Visible-virtuals-available? now just calls check-with-environment-for-visible-virtuals
;;;             :   if it's defined to avoid having to redefine visible-virtuals-available?
;;;             :   it later.
