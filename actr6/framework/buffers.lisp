;;; 2004.08.20 Dan
;;;             : Creation
;;;
;;; 2004.12.13 Dan
;;;             : Added :details to the scheduled buffer events to clean up the
;;;             : traces.
;;;             : Reduced lines down to max of 80 chars.
;;; 2005.01.17 Dan
;;;             : * Removed calls to format in the scheduling.
;;; 2005.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Removed call to get-parameters.
;;; 2005.02.01 Dan
;;;             : * Modified buffer-chunk so it prints the chunks as well when
;;;             :   specific buffers requested.
;;; 2005.02.03 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the default output for some functions to 'medium
;;;             :   or 'low to play friendly with the new detail level.
;;; 2005.02.04 Dan
;;;             : * Taking advantage of the fast-* chunk accessors.
;;; 2005.04.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added buffers-module-name to add to the API.
;;; 2005.04.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added the buffer-status command to print out the queries
;;;             :   for buffers.  Works basically like buffer-chunk.
;;;             : * Added the status-printing option to buffer definition
;;;             :   list (the fifth item) so a module can print extra status
;;;             :   info with buffer-status.
;;;             : * Added the requested keyword to the set-buffer-chunk 
;;;             :   command because the requested (formerly stuffed) status
;;;             :   of the buffer is being maintained internally now.
;;;             : * Updated the query-buffer command to handle buffer
;;;             :   requested/unrequested instead of passing it to the module.
;;;             : * For now, an overwrite always sets the requested to nil,
;;;             :   but maybe that needs to be user defineable too.
;;; 2005.05.11 Dan
;;;             : * Adjusted the params in the schedule-set-buffer-chunk
;;;             :   call so that requested chunks don't have to show that
;;;             :   in the trace - only unrequested chunks are marked.
;;; 2005.08.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added the uninstall-buffers function to support the 
;;;             :   undefine-modules function.  This is not designed to be used
;;;             :   any other way - buffer removal is a dangerous thing.
;;;             : * Updated the version to 1.0.
;;; 2005.08.16 Dan
;;;             : * Changes necessary to allow query of error t/nil without
;;;             :   any change to the module code - a module just has to 
;;;             :   respond to the "state error" query and the query-module
;;;             :   function handles the mapping now.  The change here is
;;;             :   to add error to the *required-buffer-queries* list
;;;             :   and to now test that on doesn't try to override a required
;;;             :   query.
;;; 2006.01.17 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the module version to 1.0 since there haven't been 
;;;             :   any problems it's time to drop the "a".
;;; 2006.01.25 Dan
;;;             : * Added an option to allow details in schedule-module-request
;;;             :   to overwrite the default.   Should make that change for all
;;;             :   of the schedule- functions at some point, but for now I 
;;;             :   only need it for the request one...
;;; 2006.07.16 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with buffer-chunk-fct because now that
;;;             :   more chunk accessors print a warning for nil it has to
;;;             :   be more careful to avoid lots of warnings.
;;; 2006.11.20 Dan
;;;             : * Added require-module-warning? and module-warning to support
;;;             :   the warning mechanism added to the modules.
;;; 2007.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Changed set-buffer-chunk so that it returns the name of the
;;;             :   copied chunk that was put into the buffer on a success and 
;;;             :   nil on any failure (instead of the requested value like it was).
;;; 2007.04.10 Dan
;;;             : * Cleaned up the warning strings for several of the schedule-*
;;;             :   functions because they had references to the function without
;;;             :   the schedule- on the front.
;;; 2007.04.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added a check for the value of the :cbct parameter to determine
;;;             :   if buffer copy actions should show a line in the trace.
;;; 2007.05.03 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in parse-buffers (which is used for module definition)
;;;             :   which would allow one to create a buffer that had a buffer
;;;             :   spread parameter that matched the name of a parameter in
;;;             :   another module.
;;; 2008.05.02 Dan
;;;             : * Added the show-buffer-chunks command for use by run-step.
;;;             :   May want to consider that a user command eventually.
;;; 2008.07.13 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the return value for overwrite-buffer-chunk and added
;;;             :   a requested keyword parameter to it like set-buffer-chunk has
;;;             :   except the default value is nil.
;;; 2008.07.14 Dan 
;;;             : * Adjusted the event for schedule-overwrite... so that it 
;;;             :   only prints requested when it's nil like set-buffer-chunk.
;;; 2008.10.30 Dan
;;;             : * Took out the sgp for :cbct and use (show-copy-buffer-trace)
;;;             :   instead.
;;; 2009.02.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added an optional parameter to module-mod-request and
;;;             :   schedule-module-mod-request to allow 'invalid' modifications
;;;             :   to be passed to the module, but the default is to still check.
;;; 2009.09.09 Dan [1.1a]
;;;             : * Very experimental addition - buffers which can have a set
;;;             :   of potential chunks.  Those potential chunks can be put into
;;;             :   the buffer without copying.  The important thing to note is that
;;;             :   there can still only be one chunk "in the buffer" at any point 
;;;             :   in time.  Not all chunks can be used in that fashion.  Chunks
;;;             :   which have been cleared from a buffer are invalid for a buffer set 
;;;             :   because modules other than the owner may now have reference to
;;;             :   them.  It's also possible for a module to mark its chunks as
;;;             :   invalid for being put into any buffer set by setting the
;;;             :   chunk's buffer-set-invalid parameter to t.  If a chunk that
;;;             :   is already in a potential set gets marked as invalid it will
;;;             :   copied if it is attempted to be set in the buffer.
;;;             :   Eventually, but not yet, productions will be able to search 
;;;             :   through that set of chunks to find a matching one insead of only
;;;             :   matching the "current" chunk in the buffer.
;;;             :   The new constructs will be called a multi-buffer and a searchable
;;;             :   buffer.  A searchable buffer will always be a multi-buffer, 
;;;             :   but not all multi-buffers have to be searchable.  The type
;;;             :   of a buffer can be specified when creating it for a module 
;;;             :   (see the updates to define-module in the modules file) and a 
;;;             :   standard buffer will be the default.
;;;             : * There are 3 new commands which can be used for multi-buffers:
;;;             :   - store-m-buffer-chunk which takes a buffer name and a chunk
;;;             :   name and adds that chunk to the set of chunks available for
;;;             :   that buffer if the chunk isn't marked as invalid for a buffer set.
;;;             :   - remove-m-buffer-chunk which takes a buffer name and a chunk
;;;             :   name and removes that chunk from the set of chunks available
;;;             :   for that buffer.
;;;             :   - get-m-buffer-chunks takes a buffer name and then returns
;;;             :   a list of the chunk names for the chunks in that buffer's
;;;             :   set of available chunks if it is a multi-buffer.
;;;             : * The following commands are modified to work with multi-buffers:
;;;             :   - set-buffer-chunk - if the buffer is a multi-buffer and the
;;;             :   chunk being set is in the current set for that buffer then
;;;             :   it is not copied before putting it into the buffer.  See
;;;             :   also the change to clear-buffer since setting a buffer has
;;;             :   an implicit clearing.
;;;             :   - overwrite-buffer-chunk - same as set-buffer-chunk except
;;;             :   of course that there is no implicit clear with overwrite.
;;;             :   - clear-buffer - if the buffer is a multi-buffer and the chunk 
;;;             :   being cleared is in the current set it is removed from
;;;             :   the current set.  Whether or not the chunk is coming from a
;;;             :   multi-buffer it will have its buffer-set-invalid parameter
;;;             :   set to t.
;;;             :   buffer-chunk - the buffer-chunk command will also show
;;;             :   the set of potential chunks when displaying info about a multi-
;;;             :   buffer.
;;;             : * One other change has been made - buffer-instance no longer
;;;             :   does the mp and model tests since it's always called from
;;;             :   code that's already done so.
;;; 2009.09.29 Dan
;;;             : * Adding an erase-buffer command which takes a chunk out of a
;;;             :   buffer without clearing it.  Essentially a null overwrite.
;;;             :   Useful for modules which work with multi-buffers and want to
;;;             :   do a "soft clear" without losing the chunk to DM.  It does
;;;             :   not have a corresponding schedule- function since it's 
;;;             :   intended only for modules' internal use.
;;; 2010.01.14 Dan
;;;             : * Extending the multi buffer options so that one can have a
;;;             :   multi-buffer which does copy its chunks.  When creating a
;;;             :   module now the options for the buffer are :multi, :search,
;;;             :   :multi-copy, and :search-copy.  The :multi-copy option 
;;;             :   doesn't seem all that useful, but the :search-copy could
;;;             :   allow a module to keep a set of chunks to search over and
;;;             :   not have to be "careful" about how they are used.
;;;             : * Added a new command for working with multi-buffers:
;;;             :   remove-all-m-buffer-chunks.  It takes a buffer name and if
;;;             :   that names a multi-buffer it removes all chunks from its 
;;;             :   current set.
;;; 2010.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a typo in parse-buffers.
;;; 2010.12.08 Dan
;;;             : * Added a check to parse-buffers to make sure a buffer's name
;;;             :   doesn't end in >, doesn't start with =, and that it isn't a 
;;;             :   keyword because those sorts of things will cause problems
;;;             :   in production parsing.
;;; 2011.04.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added some declaims to avoid compiler warnings about 
;;;             :   undefined functions.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Suppress warnings about extending chunks at initial load.
;;; 2013.01.28 Dan
;;;             : * Removed a call to valid-slot-name and replaced it with the
;;;             :   command valid-chunk-type-slot.
;;; 2013.04.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added an additional keyword parameter to schedule-mod-buffer-chunk,
;;;             :   :extend.  If specified as t (default is nil) then it will 
;;;             :   first extend the chunk in the buffer if needed before making
;;;             :   the modifications.  This replaces the extend-buffer-chunk
;;;             :   command which was used separately in the production code to
;;;             :   make things more general and easily provide the extension
;;;             :   capability to modules through buffer modification requests.
;;; 2013.05.20 Dan [1.2]
;;;             : * Extend-buffer-chunk now passes the chunk name to extend-
;;;             :   chunk-type-slots since with static chunks we want to change
;;;             :   the chunk's type directly instead of "adding" a new slot.
;;;             : * Valid-chunk-modification now tests for possible slots instead
;;;             :   of valid-slots since a static chunk doesn't need to be 
;;;             :   extended again just because it doesn't currently have such
;;;             :   a slot.
;;; 2013.10.18 Dan
;;;             : * Changed buffer-spread so that it doesn't have to call sgp
;;;             :   and no-output.  No need for a module to use the external
;;;             :   interfaces from an internal function.
